<h2>LETTERS TO A DÉBUTANTE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Gladys</span>,&mdash;You have made immense progress since you
first came out. Still, you will be all the better for an occasional hint
from your more sophisticated friend. Your brief engagement to the
serious young stamp-collector was&mdash;whatever may be said against it&mdash;at
least, an experience, and I don't at all disapprove of <span class="smcap">Cissy</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Baby Beaumont</span>, and the other clever boys, but&mdash;why call Captain
<span class="smcap">Mashington "Jack"</span>? That wonderful tennis-player,
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lorne Hopper</span> has merely, tacitly,
<i>lent</i> him to you, she will soon be in London
again, and then, shooting and theatricals over,
"<span class="smcap">Jack</span>" will also go back to the city of mist
and fog. You will be obliged to return him,
whether "with thanks" or not. He is definitely
charming, but charmingly indefinite,
and, in fact, he is playing with you as you and
<span class="smcap">Oriel</span> played with each other, as Miss <span class="smcap">Toogood</span>
is now playing with <span class="smcap">Oriel</span>, and as someone (let
us hope) will, some day, play with Miss <span class="smcap">Toogood</span>.
Of course, as long as you both know it's
a game and "play the rules" it's all right.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<a href="images/229b.png">
<img src="images/229b.png"
alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I enjoyed your letter telling me how "splendidly"
the theatricals went off, and that
"everyone said it was a great success." My
dear child, you are delightful&mdash;quite refreshing;
and have kept, in all its early bloom,
your astonishing talent for believing that people
mean, literally, what they say. How on earth
can you, or any of the other performers, know
whether it was a success or not? Of course
everyone <i>said</i> it was. Quite so; who would be
rude enough to say it was a failure? The more atrocious the
performance, the more praise it would get. Guests <i>invariably</i>
flatter amateurs to their faces; and, on the other hand, however
admirable it may have been, they <i>never</i> fail to abuse it to everyone
else. I don't know whether it's jealousy, or simply irritation at
being obliged to sit still (generally in the dark), and look on while
others are showing off and enjoying themselves; but I <i>do</i> know that
they criticise severely, without exception, all amateur entertainments.
As I am your most intimate friend, of course people think it
safe to disparage you to me, and I have had various accounts. All
the men agreed that it was "awful rot," and the women that it was
quite absurd, very dull, and as long as the Cromwell Road; that
our dear <span class="smcap">Cissy</span> was quite too ridiculously conceited as a manager,
attempting effects, suitable only for Drury Lane, on a tiny drawing-room
stage; for instance, those dreadful stone steps, on which you
were to "trip down," and over which you tripped up. You see, my
informant caught you tripping!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cissy</span>, poor incompetent darling, made, it seems, touching
attempts to be "topical," and "up to date," by allusions of the
tritest and lamest description to the Empire, the <span class="smcap">Czar</span>, and dynamite,
and by wearing a huge green carnation. The whole thing completely
missed fire, I am told; and was the usual tedious exhibition
of complacent young vanity. You're too sensible to be offended,
dear, especially as I can no more form a judgment from <i>their</i>
description than from yours&mdash;knowing you all to be prejudiced.
However, I quite believe you looked sweet in your pretty costume,
and I wish I had been there to see the fun.</p>

<p>Last night, at dinner, I met your old admirer, Mr. <span class="smcap">Goldbeiter</span>.
He told me he wanted to be married, and asked me "to look out
for a nice wife for him." I am afraid the sort of man who says that
lives to be an old bachelor. I could have looked after him better,
but that on my other side was a person in whom I take great
interest; that is to say, someone I have only just met. The <span class="smcap">Lyon
Taymers</span> would like him. He is a writer, perfectly "new"; and
at present the cause of great disputes as to who discovered him. He
is beautiful, of course young, and will be very agreeable when he has
settled on his pose; at present, he's a little undecided about it.</p>

<p>Not having read a line of his, or even knowing he was an author,
I began with my usual formula, "I am <i>so</i> interested in your work,
Mr. <span class="smcap">de Trouvaille</span>" (he's French by descent). He was a little
doubtful of me at first, but I think we shall become friends. He said
nothing about having met me in a previous existence, did not ask if
I believed in instantaneous sympathy, and omitted to inquire which
was <i>not</i> my day at home. So, you see, he is not quite like everyone
else. Before the end of dinner, he had spoken, very respectfully, but
not unfavourably, of my eyes, and he is going to send me his book,
<i>Enchantment</i>. He belongs to the new literary school they call
"Sensitivists." I wonder what it means! Good-bye, dear.</p>

<h2>A POLITICAL CONFERENCE.</h2>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The interior of a classic Country
Villa. Present&mdash;An aged, illustrious,
but retired, Statesman and Leader, engaged
now in thrumming a lyre. To
him enter his youthful successor, with
certain scrolls.</i></p>

glad you have come! The very man I wished

well, my dear <span class="smcap">Gladstonius</span>.</p>

gods!&mdash;<i>and</i> the ocularius!</p>

<p><i>Juvenis.</i> Ah! <span class="smcap">Cincinnatus</span>, in retirement,
pleased himself with the plough; <i>your</i> recreation
was wont to be the axe or the banjo;
<i>now</i> I perceive it is the&mdash;harp!</p>

<p><i>Senex</i> (<i>sharply</i>). Not at all, <span class="smcap">Primula</span>, not
at all. <i>This</i> is not a harp!</p>

<p><i>Senex</i> (<i>modestly</i>). Very pretty! But I fear
the ever-youthful Muses may disdain an Old
Man's belated wooing.</p>

<p><i>Juvenis</i> (<i>slily</i>). Even a <i>Grand</i> Old Man's?</p>

<p><i>Senex</i> (<i>shuddering</i>). Nay, no more of that,
an' you love me. By the way, I wanted to
consult you on a little musical matter.</p>

<p><i>Juvenis</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). Ah! Concerning yon
Hibernian Harp, I presume?</p>

<p><i>Senex</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). Dear me, no! The
Hibernian Harp be&mdash;jangled. As, indeed, it
is, and unstrung into the bargain.</p>

<p><i>Juvenis</i> (<i>relieved</i>). Why, have you then,
like the <i>other</i> Minstrel Boy, "torn its chords
asunder"?</p>

<p><i>Senex.</i> Well, no, not that exactly. I fear
its native thrummers will spare others that
trouble. But&mdash;ahem!&mdash;it is the Horatian
Lyre that interests me at present.</p>

<p><i>Juvenis.</i> I see:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Senex</i> (<i>musingly</i>). Hum! I have not yet

<p><i>Juvenis.</i> Doubtless; and you are quite equal
to it.</p>

<p><i>Senex</i> (<i>drily</i>). Thanks! But I've no wish,
my dear <span class="smcap">Primula</span>, "to play the <i>rôle</i> of elderly
<i>Narcissus</i>." At present my part is only that
of <i>Echo</i>&mdash;to the Venusian's vibrant voice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>Muses.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Juvenis</i> (<i>taking advantage of the opportunity</i>).
Well, my dear <span class="smcap">Gladstonius</span>, there
are one or two little matters upon which I
want to take your opinion. For example,
<span class="smcap">Cæcilius</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Senex</i> (<i>quickly</i>). "<span class="smcap">Cæcilius</span>, who provoked
the populace to such a degree, that <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>
could hardly restrain them from doing him
violence." Do you want me to play the part
of <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>?</p>

<p><i>Juvenis</i> (<i>taken aback</i>). Well&mdash;ahem!&mdash;hardly
<i>that</i>, perhaps. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Senex</i> (<i>interrupting him</i>). My dear
<span class="smcap">Primula</span>, as I have already said in response
to an appeal from a friend of the modern
<span class="smcap">Orbilius</span> (<i>not</i> like <span class="smcap">Horace's</span> pedagogue,
"<i>Plagosus</i>," though), "After a contentious
life of fifty-two years, I am naturally
anxious to spend the remainder of my days
in freedom from controversy."</p>

<p><i>Juvenis.</i> Oh! Quite so&mdash;of course. But
ahem!&mdash;the people are a little pressing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Senex.</i> Eh? To hurtful measures? What
says <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>'s "pleasant mannikin" again,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à propos?</i></p>

<h2>FASHION AND FELONY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch, Sir</span>,&mdash;Magistrates are beginning,
not a moment too soon, to protest against
the ridiculous pockets in ladies' dresses, which
afford such a temptation to the felonious
classes! I should like to draw attention to
an invention of my own which, I think, quite
meets the difficulty. It is called the "Patent
Unpickable Electrical Safety Pneumatic Combination
Purse-Pocket," and it does not matter
in the least in what part of the dress this
pocket is placed. No sooner is the thief's
hand in contact with the purse than a powerful
voltaic circuit is at once formed, and by
the principle of capillary attraction, coupled
with that of molecular magnetisation, the
hand is firmly imprisoned. Scientific readers
will readily understand how this happens. In
his efforts to release his hand the thief touches
a button, when an electrical search light of
five thousand candle-power is at once thrown
around, a policeman's rattle of a peculiarly
intense tone is set going, several land torpedoes
discharge simultaneously from all sides
of the dress, while the voice of a deceased
judge issuing from a concealed phonograph
pronounces a sentence of seven years' penal
servitude on the now conscience-stricken depredator.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>A deputy-assistant of the Baron has been perusing with great contentment
<i>The Catch of the County</i>, by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Edward Kennard</span>, a lady who is already
responsible for <i>The Hunting Girl</i>; <i>Wedded to Sport</i>, and a number of
other romances dear to the heart of those who follow the hounds. The
deputy-assistant reports that he was delighted with the newest of the
authoress's novels, and found the three volumes rather too short than
too long. Now that London is in the midst of November and its fogs,
those who dwell near the frosted-silvery Thames can take a real pleasure
in stories of the country. To sum up, <i>The Catch of the County</i> must (to
adopt the slang of the moment) have "caught on." A fact that must be as
satisfactory to Mrs. <span class="smcap">Kennard</span> as to her readers. And when both supply and
demand are pleased, Messrs. <span class="smcap">F. V. White &amp; Co.</span>, the publishers, must
also (like <i>Cox</i> and <i>Box</i>) be "satisfied."</p>

<p>A Baronitess writes: "Gaily-bound Christmas books have been
facing me for some time, and, with an insinuating look, seem to say,
'Turn over a new leaf.' We do; many new leaves."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackie and Son</span> could be called first favourites in the boys' field
of literature. They make a good start with <i>Wulf the Saxon</i> and
<i>In the Heart of the Rockies</i>, both by <span class="smcap">G. A. Henty</span>. They are both
capital specimens of the Hentyprising hero.</p>

<p><i>In Press-Gang Days.</i> By <span class="smcap">Edward Pickering</span>. A story, not a
newspaper romance, though it is a new edition of the type of the
wicked uncle, who makes use of "the liberty of the Press" to have his
nephew bound&mdash;as if he were a book worth preserving&mdash;and taken off
to sea. This proceeding made an impression on our good brave youth,
who, after fighting with <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>, learnt that "an Englishman should
do his duty," escapes a French prison, and returns to "give what
for" to his uncle.</p>

<p>Most interesting and practical is <i>The Whist Table</i>, edited by <span class="smcap">Portland</span>,
especially to those whose only idea of the game is after the
style of the man in <i>Happy Thoughts</i> who knows that the scoring had
something to do with a candlestick and half-a-crown. In this book
they will find a helping hand which gives the "c'rect" card to play.
Both these books, published by <span class="smcap">John Hogg</span>, are pig-culiarly good.</p>

<p>"A powerful finish," quoth the Baron, leaning upon the chair-arm,
and, like the soldier in the old ballad, wiping away a tear which
he had most unwillingly shed over the last chapter of <i>Children of
Circumstance</i>, "a very powerful finish. There is some comedy, too,
in the story (which, I regret to say, is spun out into three volumes)&mdash;rather
Meredithian perhaps, but still forming some relief to the sicknesses,
illnesses and deaths&mdash;there are certainly three victims of
<span class="smcap">Iota</span>'s steel and one doubtful&mdash;of which the narrative has more than
its fair share." Of the comedy portion, the courtship of <i>Jim</i> and <i>Rica</i>
is excellent. But where other novels err in superfluity of description
and lack of dialogue, the fault of this one is just the other way, and
the dialogues may be, not "skipped," but bounded over. Nothing
of the earlier portion, nor the powerful final chapter of this story can
be missed: as for the intermediate stage, when the intelligent and
experienced novel-reader has once grasped the characters, he can
drop in on them now and then, in a friendly way, and see how they
are getting on.</p>

<p>The Baron congratulates Messrs. <span class="smcap">Macmillan</span> on a charming little
book called <i>Coridon's Songs</i>, which are not all songs sung by that
youthful Angler-Saxon whose parent was <span class="smcap">Izaak Walton</span>, but also
songs by <span class="smcap">Gay</span>, <span class="smcap">Fielding</span>, and Anonymi. To these worthy Master
<span class="smcap">Austin Dobson</span> hath written a mighty learned and withal entertaining
preface, the gems of the book being the illustrations, done by
<span class="smcap">Hugh Thomson</span> in his best style, "wherewith," quotes the incorrigible
Baron, "I am Hughgely pleased." 'Tis an excellent
Christmas present, as, "if I may be permitted to say so," quoth the
Baron, <i>sotto voce</i>, "to those whom Providence hath blest with
friends and relatives expecting gifts in the coming 'festive season,'
is also a certain single volume entitled <i>Under the Rose</i>, an illustrated
work, not altogether unknown, as a serial, in <i>Mr. Punch's</i>
pages, and highly recommended by</p>

<h2>GISMONDA.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>To Mr. Punch.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mister</span>,&mdash;To you, who are a so great lover of the theatre,
english and french, I send my impressions of the first of the new drama
of Mister <span class="smcap">Sardou</span>. It is to you of to spread them in the country of the
immortal <span class="smcap">Shikspir</span>. Allow that I render my homages to this name
so illustrious, me who have essayed since so long time to speak and to
write the language of that great author. And see there, in fine I can
to do it!</p>

<p>It wants me some words for to praise the put in scene of this new drama
at the theatre of Mistress <span class="smcap">Sarah Bernhardt</span>. <i>Gismonda!</i> It is
magnificent! It is superb! It is a dream! Ah! if your <span class="smcap">Shikspir</span> could see
this luxury of decorations, this all together so glorious! Him who had
but a curtain and an etiquette! And <span class="smcap">Molière</span>? And <span class="smcap">Racine</span>? Could they make
to fabricate of such edifices, of such trees, of such furniture? They
had not these&mdash;how say you in english&mdash;"proprieties," which belong to
the proprietor? Yes, I think that I have heard the phrase, "offend
against the proprieties." We never offend against them in the theatres
of Paris; they are always as it should be. But here, at the Renaissance,
Mistress <span class="smcap">Bernhardt</span> has done still more. Each scenery is a picture of the
most admirables, a veritable blow of the eye.</p>

<div class="figright w25">
<a href="images/233b.png">
<img src="images/233b.png"
alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I go to give you of them a short description. The first picture is the
Acropolis, under the domination of the Florentines at the end of the
fourteenth century. What perfume of poetry antique! What costumes! That
has the air of an account of <span class="smcap">Boccaccio</span>, of a picture of <span class="smcap">Botticelli</span>. One
sees there the figures of <span class="smcap">Angelico</span>, the colours of <span class="smcap">Veronese</span>. It is an
<span class="smcap">Alma-Teddama</span> of the middle age. And when Mistress <span class="smcap">Bernhardt</span> and her
following, all resplendent of costume, are assembled upon the scene, one
can see realised a group from the <i>Decameron</i>. And the second picture,
and the third, and the fourth? Can I say more of them? They are superb.
In the fourth there is a cypress high of six yards, there, alone, at the
middle of the scene. One says he is natural. That may be. In any case he
is marvellous. But the fifth picture, it is sublime! One cannot more! It
is the last word of the modern theatre! It wants me the words, it wants
me the place for to speak of it. <span class="smcap">Shikspir</span> alone would have could to
render justice to this picture so ravishing.</p>

<p>As to the action of the piece, you will desire to know something.
Frankly I tell you I observed it not. In the middle of this luxury
of decorations there wander here and there some persons, dressed at
the mode the most beautiful, who speak in effect not too shortly.
There are veritable discourses&mdash;how say you <i>"conférences"?</i>&mdash;on
florentine history, of the most interestings, but a little long. The
brave Frenchmans pronounce the Italian names in good patriots.
They imitate not the accent of our perfidious neighbours of the
Triple Alliance. Ah no! They say them as in french. And what
names! <i>Acciajuoli!</i> It is like a sneeze. And Mistress <span class="smcap">Bernhardt</span>
is gentle, caressing, passionate, contemptuous, and terrible turn to
turn; she murmurs softly, and at the fine she screams. And
Mister <span class="smcap">Guitry</span> is severe and menacing; he speaks at low voice, and
at the fine he shouts. But after all what is that that is that that?
One thinks not to it. The decorations, the costumes! See there
that which one regards, that which one applauds, that which one
shall forget never!</p>

<p>Be willing to agree the assurance of my high consideration.</p>

inwinted Mayernase sauce (ah! bother the spellin' now), and called
it after himself and his eldest son, Lord <span class="smcap">Naas</span>; faix, there ye have
it, Mayonaas; and isn't it called Paddy Bourke's butther to this
day all over County Kildare; and many a bite of could salmon have
I ate wid that same; and don't believe, Sorr, thim that tell you it's
onwholesome, for, if you'll get the laste sup of the crathur wid it,
it's just as harmless as new milk from the cow; and shure it's

<p>I have supposed that you have been
appointed Secretary to the Public Squander
Department. You will have much to do, so
the less you have to read, the better. Under
these circumstances, I merely supply you at
this moment with the following</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Examination Paper for Would-be
Private Secretaries.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>1. Give your autobiography, either as (1) a
good story against yourself, (2) a minute in
four lines, or (3) a long yarn suitable for filling
up the time when things have to be kept
going for three-quarters of an hour to accommodate
your chief.</p>

<p>2. Describe your duties to your chief (1)
when he is in town but wants to be thought
away in the country, and (2) when you have
to assist him as "Vice-chair" at a dinner
party.</p>

<p>3. Given that you have for neighbours at a
political banquet a race-horse owner, a supporter
of the temperance cause, a theatrical
proprietor, and a rural dean. Write an
anecdote that will interest all of them, and
cause the conversation between them to be
general.</p>

<p>4. Take the following facts. Owing to a
blunder, a ship has been sent to a wrong port,
carrying a wrong cargo to a wrong receiver,
who has sent it away, and thus prevented it
being used for its right purpose. This trifling
error of judgment has caused a war that could
easily have been prevented. Explain all this
away in such a manner that the statement
when delivered by your chief shall be received
with "general cheering" in the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>5. Write a short essay showing your points
and testing your capabilities.

<p>I said, when I last took up my pen as a veracious chronicler of the
recent history of Mudford (for this is the name of our village; not
elegant, perhaps, but none the less true to life), that my meeting
deserved a chapter to itself. It does. It deserves, in point of fact,
many chapters, though I only purpose to give it one. But it must be the
third chapter, and not the second. For before this meeting was held,
many things happened, and as I look back I often wonder how it was that
I was enabled to endure all the trials and tribulations which Fortune
had in store for me, and that I am spared to write this unpretending
account of all that happened. I say this, because I have been reading of
late historical romances, and I find from them that a little moralising
is never out of place in the course of a story.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to issue a bill, stating that the meeting
would be held. It was headed, "Mudford," and announced that I&mdash;described
as <span class="smcap">Timothy Winkins</span>, Esq., J.P. (for I boast that proud distinction
through an error of the Lord Chancellor of the period, who mistook me
for a member of his party, which I was not)&mdash;that I would explain the
provisions and working of the Parish Councils Act, that "questions would
be invited at the close," and that "all persons were cordially invited
to attend." I sent a copy of this to every one in the village, and then
fondly imagined that I should hear no more about the matter till the
fateful night approached. In that I was mistaken, however.</p>

<p>Next morning, as I was sitting in my study&mdash;curiously enough getting
ready some notes for what was to be my epoch-making speech&mdash;I saw coming
up the drive two ladies, whom I recognised as Mrs. <span class="smcap">Letham Havitt</span> and
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span>, both ladies, I remembered, who had made themselves
prominent in politics in the village, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Havitt</span> as a leading light of
the Women's Liberal Federation, and Mrs. <span class="smcap">March</span> as a Lady Crusader (is
that right?) of the Primrose League. A moment later, and those ladies
were ushered into my room.</p>

<p>"We've come," said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Havitt</span>, cutting the cackle, and coming
at once to the 'osses, "we've come to see you about that meeting."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" I murmured. "Yes, the meeting."</p>

<p>"We notice," said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span>, taking up the running,
"that you only say 'persons' may attend the meeting. Now we're
very much afraid that women won't understand that they may come."</p>

<p>"But surely," I protested, feebly, "a woman is a person."</p>

<p>"Well, we think" (<i>this as a duet</i>) "that you ought to say that 'all
persons, men or women, married or single, are invited to attend.'"</p>

<p>I was a good deal staggered, and thought of asking whether they
wouldn't like the name of the village altered, or my name printed
without the J.P., but I refrained. I promised to print new bills, and
I did it. I thought it would be a poor beginning to a peaceful revolution
to have an angry woman in every household.</p>

<p>Those were my first visitors. After that I had about two calls a
day. One day the Vicar dropped in to afternoon tea, to congratulate
me on my public spirit. I confess I felt rather pleased. I had
evidently done the right, the high-minded, the patriotic thing. My
mind became filled with visions of myself as Chairman of the Parish
Council, the head man of a contented village. Just before he left,
however, the Vicar suggested that I should advise the electors to
elect into the chair someone who had had previous training of what
its duties and responsibilities were, and I suddenly remembered that
the Vicar was the present Chairman of the Vestry. Then somehow
I guessed why I had been favoured with a visit. The curious thing
was, that my next caller (who arrived half an hour afterwards)
came to say that the most satisfactory thing in the whole Act was,
that the clergyman could not take the chair. Then my memory once
more told me what manner of man I was talking to&mdash;he was a
prominent local preacher. I was being nobbled.</p>

<p>And so it went on. My answer to all who came was, that they
could come and ask me questions at the meeting. Is was a convenient
plan enough&mdash;at the time. Yet my suggestions&mdash;like
chickens and curses&mdash;came home to roost&mdash;at the meeting. And that,
as I have said, is the third chapter.</p>

<h2>FIRST IMPRESSIONS.</h2>

<p>Florence! O glorious city of <span class="smcap">Lorenzo</span> the Magnificent, cradle of
the Renaissance, birthplace of <span class="smcap">Dante</span>, home of <span class="smcap">Boccaccio</span>, where
countless painters and sculptors produced those deathless works
which still fascinate an admiring world, at last I approach thee! I
arrive at the station, I scramble for a <i>facchino</i>, I drive to my hotel.
It is night. To-morrow all thy medieval loveliness will burst upon
my enraptured eyes.</p>

<p>In the morning up early and out. Immediately fall against a
statue of a fat man in a frock coat and trousers. Can this be
<span class="smcap">Michael Angelo's</span> <i>David?</i> No, no! It is <i>Manin</i> by <span class="smcap">Nono</span>. Turn
hastily aside and discover a quay. Below is a waste of mud, through
which meander a few inches of thick brown water. The Arno!
Heavens, what associations! Raise my eyes and perceive on the
opposite bank a gasometer. Stand horror-stricken in the roadway,
and am nearly run over by a frantic bicyclist. Save myself by a
great effort and cling for support to a gaslamp until I can recover
from the shock. Resolve then to seek out the medieval loveliness.
Start along the quay. Ha, there is a statue! Doubtless by <span class="smcap">Michael
Angelo</span>. Hardly; the face seems familiar. Of course, it is <span class="smcap">Garibaldi</span>!
Turn and fly up a narrow street. Here at last is something
old, here at last are the buildings on which <span class="smcap">Dante</span> may have looked,
in which <span class="smcap">Fra Angelico</span> may have painted, here at last&mdash;&mdash;. Why,
what's this? It's an omnibus. It fills the street. Wedge myself
in a doorway, and when it has passed within three inches of my toes,
hurry down a side street, a still narrower one. Here, perhaps, <span class="smcap">Benvenuto
Cellini</span> devised some glorious metal work. Ha, there is a
silversmith's even to this day! Look! what are those things in the
window, above the inscription "English Spoken"? They are teapots
from Birmingham! Resolve to avoid small streets, and hurry
on to large open piazza. Now for some architecture by <span class="smcap">Giotto</span>, some
sculpture by <span class="smcap">Donatello</span>! Yes, there is an equestrian statue.
Doubtless one of the <span class="smcap">Medici</span>. At last! No, it's not. It's <span class="smcap">Victor
Emanuel</span>. At least, the inscription says so, though the likeness, not
being a speaking one, gives no information. Turn sadly aside and
contemplate some melancholy modern copies of the regular architecture
of rectangular Turin.</p>

<p>Begin to feel depressed. Have not yet found the romantic
medievalism. Somewhat revived by <i>déjeuner</i>, resolve to seek it in
the suburbs. Of course, Fiesole. A pilgrimage to the home of <span class="smcap">Fra
Angelico</span>. Sublime! Will go on foot, avoiding the high road.
Climb by narrow ways, past garden walls. Behind them may be the
gardens where <span class="smcap">Boccaccio's</span> stories were told; down these narrow
roads <span class="smcap">Fra Angelico</span> may have passed. How exquisite to meditate
far from the tourist crowd! Filled with enthusiasm, and gazing at
the beautiful blue sky, arrive at the top, and stumble headlong over
some obstacle in the road. It is the rail of a tramway! Stagger
feebly to the Piazza just as the electric tramcar bumps and rumbles
up the hill. From it descends a crowd, carrying, not lilies, as in
<span class="smcap">Angelico</span>'s pictures, but Bædekers. And I hear no tale from the
<i>Decameron</i>, but a mingled confusion of strange tongues. "<i>Ja, ja,
ja</i>; what a squash; <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nous étions un peu serrés mais enfin</i>; <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">ach wunderschön</i>;
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">un soldo signore</i>; <i xml:lang="fi" lang="fi">ja, ja, ja</i>; wal, I guess this is
Feaysolay, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">che rumore nel tram</i>; I say, let's buy one of these straw
fans for Aunt <span class="smcap">Mary</span>; they're awfully cheap, only half a franc, and
look worth half-a-crown; <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ah voilà le café</i>; <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">wollen sie ein Glas Bier
trinken</i>; <i xml:lang="fi" lang="fi">ja, ja, ja!</i>" Resolve to abandon search for medieval
loveliness, and go down sadly in the tramcar.</p>

<p>But one art remains. In the country where <span class="smcap">Verdi</span> still writes
I can at least enjoy music. So after dinner seek the Trianon. It
sounds like a music-hall; but then here, even in a music-hall, there
must be music. As I enter, a familiar sound bursts upon my ear.
The singer is Italian, the words are French, but the tune is English.

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene XXX.</span>&mdash;<i>Lady Maisie's Room at Wyvern.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Time</span>&mdash;<i>Saturday night, about 11.30.</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>, <i>who is brushing her hair</i>). You are
<i>sure</i> Mamma isn't expecting me? (<i>Irresolutely.</i>) Perhaps I had
better just run in and say good night.</p>

<p><i>Phillipson.</i> I wouldn't recommend it, really, my lady; her ladyship
seems a little upset in her nerves this evening.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Il-y-à de quoi!</i> (<i>Aloud, relieved.</i>)
It might only disturb her, certainly.... I hope they are making you
comfortable here, <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>?</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Very much so indeed, thank you, my lady. The tone of the
Room downstairs is <i>most</i> superior.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> <i>That</i>'s satisfactory. And I hear you have met an old
admirer of yours here&mdash;Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, I mean.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> We <i>did</i> happen to encounter each other in one of the
galleries, my lady, just for a minute; though I shouldn't have
expected <i>him</i> to allude to it!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Indeed! And why not?</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">James Spurrell</span> appears to have elevated himself to a
very different sphere from what he occupied when <i>I</i> used to know
him, my lady; though how and why he comes to be where he is, I don't
rightly understand myself at present.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>to herself</i>). And no wonder! I feel horribly guilty!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) You mustn't blame poor Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>, <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>; <i>he</i>
couldn't help it!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> (<i>with studied indifference</i>). I'm not blaming him, my lady.
If he prefers the society of his superiors to mine, he's very welcome
to do so; there's others only too willing to take his place!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Surely none who would be as fond of you or make so
good a husband, <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> That's as maybe, my lady. There was one young man that
travelled down in the same compartment, and sat next me at supper
in the room. I could see he took a great fancy to me from the
first, and his attentions were really quite pointed. I am sure I
couldn't bring myself to repeat his remarks, they were so flattering!</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Don't you think you will be rather a foolish girl if
you allow a few idle compliments from a stranger to outweigh such
an attachment as Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> seems to have for you?</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> If <i>he</i>'s found new friends, my lady, I consider myself free
to act similarly.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Then you don't know? He told us quite frankly
this evening that he had only just discovered you were here, and
would much prefer to be where you were. He went down to the
Housekeeper's Room on purpose.</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> (<i>moved</i>). It's the first I've heard of it, my lady. It must
have been after I came up. If I'd only known he'd behave like
<i>that!</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>instructively</i>). You see how loyal he is to <i>you</i>. And
now, I suppose, he will find he has been supplanted by this new
acquaintance&mdash;some smooth-tongued, good-for-nothing valet, I
daresay?</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> (<i>injured</i>). Oh, my lady, indeed he wasn't a <i>man!</i> But
there was nothing serious between us&mdash;at least, on <i>my</i> side&mdash;though
he certainly did go on in a very sentimental way himself. However,
he's left the Court by now, that's <i>one</i> comfort! (<i>To herself.</i>) I
wish now I'd said nothing about him to <span class="smcap">Jem</span>. If he was to get asking
questions downstairs&mdash;&mdash;He always <i>was</i> given to jealousy&mdash;reason
or none!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>A tap is heard at the door.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>outside</i>). <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, may I come in? if you've done your
hair, and sent away your maid. (<i>She enters.</i>) Ah, I see you haven't.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Don't run away, <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>; my maid has just done. You can
go now, <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>to herself, as she sits down</i>). <span class="smcap">Phillipson</span>! So
<i>that</i>'s the young woman that funny vet man prefers to Us! H'm, can't
say I feel flattered!</p>

<p><i>Phill.</i> (<i>to herself, as she leaves the room</i>). This must be the Lady
<span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>, who was making up to my <span class="smcap">Jem</span>! He wouldn't have anything to say to
her, though; and, now I see her, I am not surprised at it!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<i>She goes; a pause.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>crossing her feet on the fender</i>). Well, we can't
complain of havin' had a dull evenin', <i>can</i> we?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>taking a hand-screen from the mantelshelf</i>). Not
altogether. Has&mdash;anything fresh happened since I left?</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Nothing particular. <span class="smcap">Archie</span> apologised to this New Man in
the Billiard Room. For the Booby Trap. We all told him he'd <i>got</i> to.
And Mr. <span class="smcap">Carrion Bear</span>, or <span class="smcap">Blundershell</span>, or whatever he calls
himself&mdash;<i>you</i> know&mdash;was so awf'lly gracious and condescendin'
that I really thought poor dear old <span class="smcap">Archie</span> would have wound up his
apology by punchin' his head for him. Strikes me, <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, that
mop-headed Minstrel Boy is a decided change for the worse. Doesn't it
you?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>toying with the screen</i>). How do you <i>mean</i>, <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>?</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> I meantersay I call Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>&mdash;&mdash;Well, he's
real, anyway&mdash;he's a <i>man</i>, don't you know. As for the other, so <i>feeble</i>
of him missin' his train like he did, and turnin' up too late for everything!
Now, <i>wasn't</i> it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Poets <i>are</i> dreamy and unpractical and unpunctual&mdash;it's
their nature.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> Then they should stay at home. Just see what a
hopeless muddle he's got us all into! I declare I feel as if anybody
might turn into somebody else on the smallest provocation after this.
I <i>know</i> poor <span class="smcap">Vivien Spelwane</span> will be worryin' her pillows like rats
most of the night, and I rather fancy it will be a close time for poets
with your dear mother, <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, for some time to come. All this
silly little man's fault!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> No, <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>. Not his&mdash;<i>ours</i>. Mine and Mamma's.
We ought to have felt from the first that there <i>must</i> be some mistake,
that poor Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> couldn't <i>possibly</i> be a poet! I don't
know, though; people generally <i>are</i> unlike what you'd expect from
their books. I believe they do it on purpose! Not that that applies
to Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>; he <i>is</i> one's idea of what a poet should be. If he
hadn't arrived when he did, I don't think I could ever have borne to
read another line of poetry as long as I lived!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> I <i>say!</i> Do you call him as good-lookin' as all <i>that?</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> I was not thinking about his looks, <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>&mdash;it's his
<i>conduct</i> that's so splendid.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> His conduct? Don't see anything splendid in
missin' a train. I could do it myself if I tried?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> Well, I wish I could think there were many men
capable of acting so nobly and generously as he did.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda.</i> As how?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie.</i> You really don't see! Well, then, you <i>shall</i>. He
arrives late, and finds that somebody else is here already in his
character. He makes no fuss; manages to get a private interview
with the person who is passing as himself; when, of course, he soon
discovers that poor Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> is as much deceived as anybody
else. What is he to do? Humiliate the unfortunate man by letting
him know the truth? Mortify my Uncle and Aunt by a public
explanation before a whole dinner-party? That is what a stupid or
a selfish man might have done, almost without thinking. But not
Mr. <span class="smcap">Blair</span>. He has too much tact, too much imagination, too much
chivalry for that. He saw at once that his only course was to spare
his host and hostess, and&mdash;and all of us a scene, by slipping away
quietly and unostentatiously, as he had come.</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>yawning</i>). If he saw all that, why didn't he <i>do</i> it?</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). Why? How provoking you can be,
<span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>! <i>Why?</i> Because that stupid <span class="smcap">Tredwell</span> wouldn't let him!
Because <span class="smcap">Archie</span> delayed him by some idiotic practical joke! Because
Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> went and blurted it all out!... Oh, don't try to run
down a really fine act like that; because you can't&mdash;you simply <i>can't!</i></p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>after a low whistle</i>). No idea it had gone so far as
that&mdash;already! <i>Now</i> I begin to see why <span class="smcap">Gerry Thicknesse</span> has been
lookin' as if he'd sat on his best hat, and why he told your Aunt he
might have to be off to-morrow; which is all stuff, because I happen
to know his leave ain't up for two or three days yet. But he sees
this Troubadour has put his poor old nose out of joint for him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Maisie</i> (<i>flushing</i>). Now, <span class="smcap">Rhoda</span>, I won't have you talking
as if&mdash;as if&mdash;&mdash; <i>You</i> ought to know, if <span class="smcap">Gerald Thicknesse</span> doesn't,
that it's nothing at all of that sort! It's just&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I can't <i>tell</i>
you how some of his poems moved me, what new ideas, wider views
they seemed to teach; and then how <i>dreadfully</i> it hurt to think it
was only Mr. <span class="smcap">Spurrell</span> after all!... But <i>now</i>&mdash;oh, the <i>relief</i> of
finding they're not spoilt; that I can still admire, still look up to
the man who wrote them! Not to have to feel that he is quite commonplace&mdash;not
even a gentleman&mdash;in the ordinary sense!</p>

<p><i>Lady Rhoda</i> (<i>rising</i>). Ah well, I prefer a hero who looks as if he
had his hair cut, occasionally&mdash;but then, I'm not romantic. He
may be the paragon you say; but if I was you, my dear, I
wouldn't expect too much of that young man&mdash;allow a margin for
shrinkage, don't you know. And now I think I'll turn into my little
crib, for I'm dead tired. Good night; don't sit up late readin'
poetry; it's my opinion you've read quite enough as it is!</p>

<h2>GILBERT AND CARR-ICATURE.</h2>

<div class="figright w25">

</div>

<p>Most of the <i>libretto</i> of <span class="smcap">W. S. Gilbert's</span> latest whimsical opera,
entitled <i>His Excellency</i>, is evident proof of <i>his</i> excellency in this particular
line and on these particular lines. Among principals, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Barrington</span> has perhaps a trifle the best of it; while the part given
to our Gee-Gee, <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">George Grossmith</span>, is not so striking as his
costume, both he and Mr. <span class="smcap">John Le
Hay</span>, whose make-up is wonderfully
good, being somewhat put in the shade
by the gaiety of the two charming
young ladies Miss <span class="smcap">Jessie Bond</span> and
Miss <span class="smcap">Ellaline Terriss</span>, who act with
a real appreciation of the fun of the situation
in which their dramatic-operatic
lot is cast. But, after all said and sung,
it is the brilliancy of the Hussars,
under the command of Corporal, afterwards
Colonel, <span class="smcap">Playfair</span>, that carries
the piece, and takes the audience by
storm. The music by Dr. <span class="smcap">Carr</span> would
not of itself carr-y the piece were "the
book" less fancifully funny than it is,
and did it not contain some capital
lines which are quickly taken by an appreciative audience. There is
plenty of "go" in the Carr-acteristic music for the dance of Hussars;
but the most catching "number" is a song of which the first bars
irresistibly call to mind the song with a French refrain sung by Miss
<span class="smcap">Nesville</span> in <i>A Gaiety Girl</i>. Was Dr. <span class="smcap">Osmond Carr</span> the composer of
that air? or as "that air" sounds vulgar, let us substitute "that
tune." If so the resemblance is accounted for, and if he wasn't,
then it is only an accidental resemblance of a few bars that at once
strikes the retentive ear of the amateur. Scenery and costumes are
all excellent in <i>His Excellency</i>.</p>

<h2>OUR "MONTHLY POPS."</h2>

<p>In the New York <i>Critic</i> a suggestion is made that it would be a
graceful thing for Editors of Magazines to bring out occasionally a
"Consolation Number," containing only rejected contributions. But
why not give the Editor's <i>reasons</i> for rejecting them as well? This
would be such a "consolation" to the public, if not to the authors!
A specimen number might be made up somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. "A Dream of Fair Wages."&mdash;A Rondel by <span class="smcap">Tennyson Keir
Hardie Morris Snooks</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Rejected as a mixture of bad politics with worse poetry.]</p></blockquote>

<p>2. "Children of Easy Circumstances."&mdash;By &Omega;. &Phi;.!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[An up-to-date story, with several risky situations in it; the risk, however,
has been reduced to a minimum by the gifted Authoress having contracted to
indemnify the Publisher and Editor against any legal consequences that may
ensue. Printed "without prejudice," and should be read in a similar spirit.]</p></blockquote>

<p>3. "On the Magnetisation of Mollusca." By <span class="smcap">Leyden Jarre</span>, F.S.L.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[Rejected because, although an extremely able and interesting paper in
itself, it is found by experience that this sort of high-science essay requires
high people to write it if it is to have a chance of being read. Nobody
under the rank of a Duke should dabble in magazine science. What's the
use of calling it a Peery-odical otherwise, eh?]</p></blockquote>

inserted.]</p></blockquote>

certainly. Fortunately the church in question is only "All Saints
